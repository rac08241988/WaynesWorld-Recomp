"""Post-generate step run by the one-click launcher builder.

The snesrecomp codegen host runs this after `snesrecomp generate`, so the
launcher produces the same tree as tools/regen.sh.

Wayne's World has no generated-code hooks yet. The Demon's
Crest template injected its widescreen hooks here
(tools/dc_apply_widescreen_hooks.py); those anchors do not exist in this
game's code, so running that injector made the step exit 1 and the
launcher's "Generate & rebuild" fail. Until this port has hooks of its own,
the step only reports and succeeds.
