/*
 * Wayne's World — widescreen scene policy.
 *
 * Adapted from the Demon's Crest host-side policy (dc_widescreen.c), but the
 * guest RAM/HUD/cull addresses in that title do not apply here. Opt-in 16:9:
 *   - Off (default): authentic 256-column 4:3 with side art / backdrop in
 *     any extra window space;
 *   - outside stage gameplay (logos, intro, title, passwords, menus,
 *     cutscenes) every BG layer is clamped, so the authentic picture sits
 *     centered with side art in the margins;
 *   - in stage gameplay BG1/BG2 render into the margins (the extra
 *     horizontal level) while BG3 stays clamped so a HUD or overlay cannot
 *     wrap. If a scene's edges would show wrap garbage, the gameplay gate
 *     keeps it clamped (side-art fallback).
 *
 * Fase 1/2 of docs/WIDESCREEN_PLAN.md (template notes, DC-specific HUD):
 *   - outside stage gameplay every BG layer is clamped;
 *   - in DC stage gameplay BG1/BG2 widened while BG3 status bar stayed native.
 *
 * Fase 3: the margins are served from the framework's world-keyed tilemap
 * store (snes/ws_shadow.c) instead of the streamed VRAM window. That store
 * is the "bigger framebuffer" this game needs: 4096x512 tiles, keyed by the
 * world camera, fed by the native viewport sweep AND by the game's own VRAM
 * uploads at write time (WsShadowOnVramWrite) — so content the game stages
 * ahead of the view is available to the margins the moment it is written.
 * Without it, a scroll shows the streamed window's stale columns in the
 * gutter until the game rewrites them.
 *
 * PpuSetExtraSpaceCentered is deliberately NOT used here: it renders the
 * native columns without writing the side margins at all (the caller would
 * have to clear them), so a reused host buffer would show the previous
 * scene's pixels there.

 * not cover stays transparent, so the scenery shows through where the bar used
 * to sit. Below the band BG3 keeps its authentic position.

 * identity remap, i.e. the authentic 4:3 layout; SNESRECOMP_WS_HUD=0 disables
 * it. BG3 must be allowed into the widened line (PpuSetWidescreenBg3Widen) for
 * the band to be live: PpuWidescreenLayerExtra gates it, and the band's merge
 * then ignores the layer's own margin content and copies only the shifted
 * source span. That is also why BG3 is no longer clamped in gameplay — the

 *     dx = objX - camX;   keep if (dx + 0x60) < 0x1C0      (X)
 *     dy = objY - camY;   keep if (dy + 0x60) < 0x1A0      (Y)
 *
 * i.e. dx in [-0x60, 0x160) = [-96, 352): the 256-px native view plus 96 px
 * of slack on each side (sprite widths, activation). The injected hook
 * (tools/dc_apply_widescreen_hooks.py) replaces the two constants with
 * 0x60 + margin and 0x1C0/0x1A0 + 2*margin, which widens BOTH sides by
 * `margin` without moving the window's base. At margin 0 the expressions
 * evaluate to the authentic constants, so the 4:3 path stays bit-identical.
 *
 * The kept object then computes its screen X/Y ($10/$12), sets its visible
 * bit ($00 bit 4) and writes its OAM entry — which is what puts it in the
 * margins.
 *
 * The sprite emitter (the bank $80/$00 function at $F689, an AOT root) is
 * the other half: its X test at $F755 hides every sprite whose 9-bit OAM X is
 * >= 256 with a low byte < 0xF3. The injected hook keeps the right margin
 * (low byte < margin) and the widened left-edge window (low byte >=
 * 0xF3 - margin) instead, so sprites that the authentic frame clips at the
 * screen edge survive in the margins; everything else keeps the authentic
 * $E0 hide. The framework decodes 256..256+extra as positive (right margin)
 * and >= that as the wrapped left margin (PpuDecodeOamX).
 *
 * Gate: the margins are only widened during stage gameplay with widescreen
 * on — a pillarboxed cutscene must not reveal objects the authentic frame
 * hides. SNESRECOMP_WS_OAM=0 disables both halves for A/B captures.
